# Clock Blocker

---

Currently a WIP project~

This is meant as a planning tool, primarily for high school/university students.

## Planned Features:

Organization by projects and sub-projects (for classes, and subdivisions within assignments)  
Sub-project categorization -- for better data analytics
"Time spent" blocking -- know how much time is planned to spend on an item  
"Time ending/breaking" blocking -- note scheduled commitments  
"Add when assigned, order before starting" -- scheduled ways to put in assignments  
Tagging of tasks within projects -- for data collection  
Prediction based on past task completion times -- takes past ~10 assignments and references them to determine likely times  
Windows/Linux compatibility  
GUI for a more 'polished' look

## Integrated Features:

Nothing done yet so...
